<p><strong>Title of Research Study:</strong> Cognitive processes in
attention and memory</p>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Matthew Crump, Ph.D. –
Associate Professor</p>
<hr />
<p>You are being asked to participate in this research study because you
are over 18 years of age. The purpose of this research study is to gain
more knowledge about the cognitive processes involved in attention and
memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you agree to participate, we will ask you to complete a
computerized task involving the following: While seated at a computer
view a series of shapes, letters, neutral pictures, or other symbols,
and be asked to make responses about the stimuli on a computer keyboard.
More detailed task instructions are provided to you in the instruction
section.</li>
<li>There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those
associated with normal computer use.</li>
<li>Although it will not directly benefit you, this study will advance
basic science on the cognitive processes involved in attention and
memory.</li>
<li>This study does not involve any medical treatment</li>
<li>Data records of your performance in the task will be stored
indefinitely, and may be shared publicly via online repositories. This
study does not collect identifying information, and all data collected
will remain anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you have any
questions, you can contact Dr. Matthew Crump by email at <a href="mailto:mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu" class="email">mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu</a>. If you have any questions
about your rights as a research participant or if you would like to talk
